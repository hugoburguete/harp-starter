# About

This is a starter package for building static HTML sites. It uses the Harp package to preprocess EJS and CSS files (although these can be changed to any file formats Harp supports) and Webpack for JS bundling.

# Commands

To start the site in development mode, run

```
npm run dev
```

The above command will watch files as well so it's suitable for development purposes.

To build the static assets, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a build folder that can be used to host the site.

# Support

I want this repo to be as simple as possible but if you have any suggestions / issues, please submit an issue and I'll 
gladly look into it.
