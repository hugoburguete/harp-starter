# About

This is a starter site for build static sites. It uses the Harp preprocessing to hanbdle EJS and CSS files (although 
these can be any file formats that Harp supports) and Webpack for JS bundling.

# Commands

To start the site in development mode, run

```
npm run dev
```

The above command will watch files as well so it's suitable for development purposes.

To build the static assets, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will create a build folder that can be used to host the site.

# Support

I want this repo to be as simple as possible but if you have any suggestions / issues, please submit an issue and I'll 
gladly look into it.
